As a Latter-day Saint, I believe in a larger scriptural canon than the average Christian. But the Bible is still, for me, the foundation of my faith. Understanding it--its history, its translations, its literary design, its teachings, and above all, its witness of Jesus Christ--those are my primary interests.
