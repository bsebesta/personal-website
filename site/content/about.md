My name is Bryan. I'm a UX designer with three-years of experience at an agency, living in Utah.

This is my blog, where I share thoughts on design, development, technology, creativity, and living well. For shorter thoughts and my "social media," you can [follow me at my Micro.blog](https://social.bryansebesta.net/). Or you can [drop me a line](mailto:hello@bryansebesta.com) directly.
