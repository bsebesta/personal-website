> My aim is to take familiar things and make
> Poetry of them, and do it in such a way
> That it looks as if was easy as could be
> For anybody to do it (although he’d sweat
> And strain and work his head off, all in vain).
> Such is the power of judgment, of knowing what
> It means to push the elements together
> In just the right way; such is the power of making
> A perfectly wonderful thing out of nothing much.
> 
> Horace, Epistles, ii.3
