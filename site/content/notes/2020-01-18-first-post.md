I'd forgotten how hard it is to make something you're proud of. You see, for the past month, I've been toiling and tinkering with this website. It's gone through a dozen iterations. Warm colors, cool colors; humanistic serifs, geometric sans-serifs; a complicated grid layout, a simple flexbox layout. I've added sections for tracking my books, my scripture study, my designs, my photographs, my reading notes. I played with different taxonomies for organizing all of it.

But in the end, I realized that I was letting the platonic ideal of a website paralyze me. I wasn't writing; I wasn't reading; I've barely been eating. All my spare cognition and surplus of time was spent in getting it all *just so*.

Finally, I remembered: all I need is a home page, and a blog page. A single typeface and simple colors. The rest? It can all come later, and it will come later. I just needed to start.

Walter Smith: "Writing is very easy. All you do is sit in front of a typewriter keyboard until little drops of blood appear on your forehead." He could have said designing and coding. Art is hard. It's a Goliath, and sometimes the only stone in our sling is to settle for something less than what we'd hoped for.
